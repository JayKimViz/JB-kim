              <p>Very clean and the employees are very curious always ready 
                  to help out.
                   They're located all over so you can find one in your travels. 
                   They have in house restaurants and bars so don’t have to go 
                   anywhere. They can accommodate office meetings. They're like a

            <p>I love how clean they always are. When I stay I never have to worry 
                if the housekeeper did a rushed clean. Always clean and on time with
                 great customer service not your run off the mill, could care less
                  employees. I've never regret a stay.</p>
